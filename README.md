## Learning Path
 ### Glosary
 + `<form>`: This element formally defines a form. It's a container element like a `<section>` or `<footer>` element, but specifically for containing forms; it also supports some specific attributes to configure the way the form behaves. All of its attributes are optional, but it's standard practice to always set at least the `action` and `method` attributes.
 + `<label>`: For usability and accessibility, we include an explicit label for each form control. Note the use of the for attribute on all `<label>` elements, which takes as its value the id of the form control with which it is associated â€” this is how you associate a form control with its label.
 + `<input>`: On this element, the most important attribute is the `type` attribute. This attribute is extremely important because it defines the way the `<input>` element appears and behaves.
 + `<select>`: This element represents a control that provides a menu of options. It is given an `id` attribute to enable it to be associated with a `<label>` for accessibility purposes, as well as a `name` attribute to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an `<option>` element nested inside the `<select>`.
 + `<fieldset>`: This element is used to group several controls as well as labels within a web form, provides a grouping for a part of an HTML form, with a nested `<legend>` element providing a caption for the `<fieldset>`.
